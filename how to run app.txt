Hey there!

Here's how to run MyServe on your device!

    1. Get started by using pip to make sure you've installed everything in requirements.txt
    Use pip3 install -r requirements.txt in the terminal to do so.
    2. Use the run.ps1 (powershell) or run.sh (bash) scripts to launch the app.
    You may run into a few privacy problems when trying to do so; if that's the case, you can
    launch the app by copying a pasting the code from the file into the terminal.
    3. Demo accounts - you'll need to use one of the demo Google accounts to access the app.
    You should use:
        - myserve.student@gmail.com to access the student portal
        - myserve.staff@gmail.com to access the staff/admin portal
        This account is actually an admin type, not staff, as you can't put admin in Gmail email addresses

        The password for both accounts is myserve123.
        
Happy MyServing!
